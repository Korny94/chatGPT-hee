    <!-- Based on my impression of you, I would say you are 4 years old. 



    good morning, good night
    
    Store basic info in local storage, like name & age 

    When the conversation has started, put the suggestions to the left

    What is your name? You have not provided me with your name yet, 
    but based on my impression of you, I would say your name is 
    "something stupid and funny".

    When you ask such poorly formulated questions, I can't answer them.

    When you click a question suggestion, it automatically answers it 

    "I am.. so smart" - good for you - did i ask?

    compliments - cocky response

    "how are you" - rude response

    insult me - "youre a meanie"

    you mama jokes - 

    tell me a joke

    fun fact 


    "why?" - why not?

    "youre / you are.. " - no you are

    "yes, no maybe" - couldnt care less, wow that says a lot about you as a person, no offense but

    calculator?

    generic yes no maybe because responses, and endswith(?)

    i am / you are - 

    because.. -
